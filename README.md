## Description 

In this project I was tasked with creating a social Media Network using mongoose. The user will be able to write post requests that will display their thoughts and be
able to add reactions as well. The project will eventually be able to add users as friends as well.


## Installation

the user should run npm i and install all the packages in the package.json file in the main directory. Then the user will then be able to direct to the command console
and run the command "npm run start", this will run the script to start the server. The packages included are Mongoose, Express, dotenv, and bcrypt for password hashing.
